# DictatorSharp
This is a general-purpose power system that aims to replicate the structural mechanics of human political organization. This utility is inspired by the book "The Dictator's Handbook," as well as the feudal hierarchy system present in Paradox Interactive's "Crusader Kings" series of games.
