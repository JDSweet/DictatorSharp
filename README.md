# DictatorSharp Framework
This is a general-purpose power system that aims to replicate the structural mechanics of human political organization. This utility is inspired by the book "The Dictator's Handbook," as well as the feudal hierarchy system present in Paradox Interactive's "Crusader Kings" series of games.

## Concepts

1.) **Power Office**: A power office is a station that can be held by a power-holder.

2.) **Power Holder**: A power holder is an entity that strives to try to acquire and hold power offices.

3.) **Power Keys**: A power key is an entity whose support can help a power-holder acquire and hold a power office.

## Dynamics

Power holders seek to acquire the support of a critical mass of power keys in order to secure and hold a power office. A "power election" (not necessarily representative of an actual democratic election) determines who holds power, and different keys have different levels of influence in determining who actually is able to acquire and hold power (i.e. the support of the military might be more important than the support of a legislature in certain contexts, or the support of an electoral college would be significantly more important than the support of the masses in a popular vote).

This creates a natural sorting of power keys into a Selectorate (the major keys whose support is imperative in acquiring power), the Influentials (the keys that can sway the balance of power one way or the other, while being less individually important than the Selectorate), and the Nominal Electorate (those who have a technical say, but who are relatively unimportant and ignorable in the grand scheme of things).

This is intended to create a fluid political system capable of producing semi-realistic political developments (political revolutions, democratic simulations, conflicts in autocratic states, feudal political dynamics, internal dynamics in various organizations, etc).
